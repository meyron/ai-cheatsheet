# AI Prompt Cheatsheets

This repository provides visual prompt reference guides for generating consistent and expressive images across various AI image generation models. Each cheatsheet focuses on a specific aspect of image prompting, helping artists, developers, and AI enthusiasts better understand prompt behavior across models.

## 📘 Cheatsheets

| Category        | Description                                                                                 |

| [Postures](./posture.md)        | Prompt cheatsheet comparing full-body postures (e.g., standing, sitting, leaning) across different model styles.            |

## 💡 Purpose

These guides are designed to:
- Provide visual comparison of prompt results across AI models
- Assist in refining prompt templates for consistent outputs
- Serve as a starting point for style experiments, LoRA testing, or pose-based prompting

> ⚠️ Images are generated locally without LoRA support and may exclude heavy models due to hardware limitations (e.g., Flux, HiDream). Contributions welcome!
