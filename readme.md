## 💡 Purpose

These guides are designed to:
- Provide visual comparison of prompt results across AI models
- Assist in refining prompt templates for consistent outputs
- Serve as a starting point for style experiments, LoRA testing, or pose-based prompting

> ⚠️ Images are generated locally without LoRA support and may exclude heavy models due to hardware limitations (e.g., Flux, HiDream). Contributions welcome!
